# Phishing-Simulation-Campaign
Designed and Deployed a phishing campaign simulation during my summer internship at NWFCU to enhance the organization's email security awareness. Leveraged numerous phishing simulation tools to create realistic targeted phishing emails. I had to brainstorm and research ideas and compare different designs with others, while also considering the successful rate of the phishing campaigns that others have created. From there I created a series of mock phishing emails and shared them amongst the security team to gain feedback to prepare for my final draft. After testing, I deployed the campaign to select employees and tracked detailed statistics on who interacted with the email. This data allowed me to identify employees who needed additional security training.

Tools & Resources

**Proofpoint**: Utilized Proofpoint to create my phishing campaign while being able to see the effectivness and metrics of emplyoees who interacted with the email. 

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Researched and gained more information about phishing techniques and aligned tactics to my current campaign.
