# Phishing-Simulation-Campaign
Designed and Deployed a phishing campaign simulation to enhance our organizations email security awareness. Leveraged numerous phishing simulation tools to create realistic targeted phishing emails. I had to brainstorm and research ideas and compare different designs with others, while also considering the successful rate of the phishing campaigns that others have created. From there I created a series of mock phishing emails and shared them amongst my cyber team to gain feedback to prepare for my final draft.After testing, I deployed the campaign to select employees and tracked detailed statistics on who interacted with the email. This data allowed me to identify employees who needed additional security training.

Tools and Resources:

**Proofpoint**: Utilized proofpoint to create my phishing campaige while being able to see the effectivness and metrics of emplyoees who interacted with the email. 

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Researched and Gained more information about phishing ta=echniques and aligned tactics to my current campaign.
